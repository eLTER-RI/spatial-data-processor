# eLTER-geospatial-data-processor
RShiny app providing templated geospatial data analysis workflows to scientists + others in the eLTER community.

### Workflows
- clipping of geospatial data by user-specified boundaries ("gridded data")
- aggregation of tabular data grouped by spatial regions, within the bounds of a DEIMS site ("non-gridded data")

### Technology
RShiny provides the interactive frontend, while Python 3 handles the analysis.
Spatial data (see shapefiles) is precomputed with geopandas for performance, leaving interactive SQL-style joins to pandas.

Developed in NERC-CEH's [datalabs](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/datalab) platform.
